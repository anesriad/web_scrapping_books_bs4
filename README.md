# This project's goal is scrapping books from a website containing 1000 books in 50 pages

It is all coded in Python, using libraries such as:
- requests
- BeautifulSoup
- Pandas


There will be 2 versions of this program:
- 1: web_scrapped_books_detailed.ipyn :
  Will provide the code on how to scrape 1 page at a time and will include plenty of comments to understand the process
  
- 2: scrapping_books_bs4.ipyn :
  will contain the full working code that scrappes data from the whole website (1000 books) and saves it into a dataframe that is exported into a CSV file for future use.


  PLUS: You'll get the CSV file containing the final output if you want to have a quick look at what the scrapping will look like in the end.
